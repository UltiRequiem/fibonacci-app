# Fibonacci Web App

Check the Fibonacci sequence directly in your browser 🚀

Made with [Preact](https://preactjs.com), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
and [The Fibonacci Module](https://github.com/UltiRequiem/fibonacci).

I originally made this site for an school presentation,
[Exposition Rehearsal Video](https://youtu.be/AaX5_RxVuwk).
